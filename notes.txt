Explanation of your flow

os.Args[0] → the program name (note-app or main.go when running via go run)

os.Args[1] → the first argument (e.g., "list", "add")

os.Args[2:] → the rest (your arguments for that command)

So when you want to test your add command, you’d run:

go run main.go add "My Title" "This is the content" "go,cli"


and for list:

go run main.go list
